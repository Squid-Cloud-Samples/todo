# Create a to-do app with Squid

Welcome to Squid Cloud! This project contains a to-do application in which you will add Squid functionality. The steps to complete the project are displayed in the frontend, so the first step is to get the frontend up and running locally.

1. Open a terminal window, and then navigate to the frontend:

```bash
cd todo/frontend
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the frontend by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Click the URL in the terminal logs to open the app (likely http://localhost:5173/). The page displays your todo application and the accompanying tutorial.

Follow the steps in the application to begin building!
