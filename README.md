# Create a to-do app with Squid

Welcome to Squid Cloud! This project contains a to-do application in which you will add Squid functionality. The steps to complete the project are displayed in the frontend, so the first step is to get the frontend up and running locally.


1. The frontend of this project is a React app that uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/cli.html). Note that Squid works with any TypeScript client; this project just happens to use React with Vite. Intall the Vite CLI:

```bash
npm install -g vite
```

2. Open a terminal window, and then navigate to the frontend:

```bash
cd todo/frontend
```

8. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

10. Start the frontend by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

11. Click the URL in the terminal logs to open the app (likely http://localhost:5173/). The page displays your todo application and the accompanying tutorial.

Follow the steps in the application to begin building!
